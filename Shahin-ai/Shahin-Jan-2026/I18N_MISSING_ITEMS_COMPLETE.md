## 2. EMAIL TEMPLATES (14 views)

All email templates need localization:

- [ ] `Views/EmailTemplates/PasswordReset.cshtml`
- [ ] `Views/EmailTemplates/MfaCode.cshtml`

- [ ] `Views/EmailTemplates/TrialValuePush72h.cshtml`

**Note**: Email templates may need special handling for HTML email formatting and may require separate resource keys for email-specific content.

---

## 3. ENUM & STATUS VALUE LOCALIZATION

### Enums Requiring Localization
Based on model files found, these enums need localization:

- [ ] Risk Status enum values
- [ ] Risk Level enum values (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- [ ] Risk Category enum values
- [ ] Evidence Status enum values
- [ ] Evidence Type enum values
- [ ] Control Status enum values
- [ ] Assessment Status enum values
- [ ] Policy Status enum values (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Published)
- [ ] Audit Status enum values
- [ ] Workflow Status enum values (from `WorkflowEnums.cs`)
- [ ] Certification Status enum values
- [ ] Incident Status enum values
- [ ] Control Test Status enum values
- [ ] Organization Profile enum values
- [ ] Tenant Status enum values
- [ ] Onboarding Step enum values

### Implementation Pattern
```csharp
// In views:
@L[$"Status_{item.Status}"]
@L[$"RiskLevel_{risk.Level}"]
@L[$"EvidenceType_{evidence.Type}"]
```

### Resource Keys Needed
Add keys like:
- `Status_Draft`, `Status_Submitted`, `Status_Approved`, `Status_Published`
- `RiskLevel_Critical`, `RiskLevel_High`, `RiskLevel_Medium`, `RiskLevel_Low`
- `EvidenceType_Document`, `EvidenceType_Screenshot`, etc.
- All enum values for all enums in the system

---

## 4. MISSING RESOURCE KEYS

As views are converted, additional resource keys will be needed. Common patterns:

### Form Labels & Placeholders
- [ ] All form field labels
- [ ] All placeholder text
- [ ] All validation messages
- [ ] All help text

### Button Labels
- [ ] All action buttons
- [ ] All navigation buttons
- [ ] All modal buttons

### Messages & Notifications
- [ ] Success messages
- [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Warning messages
- [ ] Info messages
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs

### Table Headers & Columns
- [ ] All table column headers
- [ ] All filter labels
- [ ] All sort indicators

### Page Titles & Headings
- [ ] All page titles
- [ ] All section headings
- [ ] All subsection headings

### Tooltips & Help Text
- [ ] All tooltip text
- [ ] All help text
- [ ] All hint text

---

## 5. JAVASCRIPT LOCALIZATION

### Client-Side Strings
- [ ] All JavaScript alert messages
- [ ] All JavaScript confirmation dialogs
- [ ] All JavaScript error messages
- [ ] All JavaScript success messages
- [ ] All JavaScript validation messages
- [ ] All JavaScript tooltips
- [ ] All JavaScript button labels

### Implementation
Ensure all JavaScript strings use `window.L()` function:
```javascript
alert(L('Error_Generic'));
confirm(L('Confirm_Delete'));
```

---

## 6. TESTING & VALIDATION

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Test language switcher on all converted views
- [ ] Verify RTL layout for Arabic on all converted views
- [ ] Test date/number formatting on all converted views
- [ ] Verify JavaScript localization on all converted views
- [ ] Test email templates in both languages
- [ ] Verify enum values display correctly in both languages

### Automated Testing (Future)
- [ ] Unit tests for resource key coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for language switching
- [ ] E2E tests for RTL/LTR layout
- [ ] Tests for enum localization
- [ ] Tests for JavaScript localization

---

## 7. DOCUMENTATION

### Missing Documentation
- [ ] Developer guide for adding new resource keys
- [ ] Guide for localizing enums
- [ ] Guide for localizing email templates
- [ ] Guide for localizing JavaScript strings
- [ ] Testing checklist for new views
- [ ] Resource key naming conventions document

---

## SUMMARY STATISTICS

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Total Views** | 337 | 100% |
| **Views Converted** | 15 | 4.5% ✅ |
| **Views Remaining** | 322 | 95.5% ⚠️ |
| **Email Templates** | 14 | 0% ⚠️ |
| **Enums to Localize** | ~15+ | 0% ⚠️ |
| **Resource Keys** | ~280+ | ~40% ✅ |
| **JavaScript Strings** | Unknown | 0% ⚠️ |

## PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)
1. Convert all Authentication views (17 views)
2. Convert all Landing page views (37 views)
3. Convert remaining Risk CRUD views (7 views)
4. Convert remaining Evidence CRUD views (11 views)
5. Add enum localization for Risk, Evidence, Control, Assessment

### Phase 2 (Short-term - 2-4 weeks)
1. Convert all Control CRUD views (9 views)
2. Convert all Assessment CRUD views (8 views)
3. Convert all Policy CRUD views (10 views)
4. Convert all Audit CRUD views (9 views)
5. Convert Admin views (PlatformAdmin, TenantAdmin)
6. Add enum localization for remaining entities

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - 1-2 months)
1. Convert Workflow views (31 views)
2. Convert Monitoring Dashboard views (4 views)
3. Convert Onboarding views (22 views)
4. Convert Email Templates (14 views)
5. Localize all JavaScript strings

### Phase 4 (Ongoing)
1. Convert remaining specialized views
2. Add missing resource keys as needed
3. Complete testing and validation
4. Update documentation

---

## ESTIMATED EFFORT

- **Phase 1**: ~72 views × 15 min/view = ~18 hours
- **Phase 2**: ~50 views × 15 min/view = ~12.5 hours
- **Phase 3**: ~71 views × 15 min/view = ~17.75 hours
- **Phase 4**: ~129 views × 15 min/view = ~32.25 hours
- **Email Templates**: 14 × 20 min = ~4.7 hours
- **Enum Localization**: ~15 enums × 30 min = ~7.5 hours
- **JavaScript Localization**: ~10 hours
- **Testing**: ~20 hours
- **Documentation**: ~5 hours

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~127 hours (~16 working days)

---

## NOTES

- Conversion pattern is well-established and documented
- Most resource keys follow consistent naming conventions
- JavaScript localization helper is ready to use
- ViewComponent for action buttons is reusable
- Infrastructure is production-ready

The remaining work is primarily mechanical conversion following the established pattern.
