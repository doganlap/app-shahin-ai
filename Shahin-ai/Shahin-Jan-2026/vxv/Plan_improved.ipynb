    "This notebook consolidates the current GRC platform state, identifies readiness gaps, and provides an actionable roadmap to reach a regulator-ready operating cadence for Saudi Arabia (KSA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current state (from service inventory):** core Onboarding, Framework, Planning, Evidence, Reporting, and Attestation are complete; Assessment, Control, Risk, Compliance, and Resilience require incremental hardening to close the lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate priorities:** (1) eliminate any mock/placeholder persistence paths, (2) close security exposures on risk data, (3) complete workflow methods so items can move end‑to‑end, and (4) standardize scoring to avoid inconsistent risk/compliance outcomes.\n"
